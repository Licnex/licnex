## Overview

Sisyphus is a project that explores the concept of continuous, automated processes - much like the mythological figure who was condemned to push a boulder uphill for eternity. This project demonstrates persistence in automation and system design.

## Key Features

- **Automated Processing**: Implements continuous automation workflows
- **Persistence**: System designed to handle failures gracefully and continue operation
- **Modular Design**: Built with extensible architecture for future enhancements

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language for automation logic
- **System Integration**: Connecting various components and processes
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception management for continuous operation

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was designing a system that could truly run continuously without human intervention. This required extensive error handling and recovery mechanisms. I learned valuable lessons about system reliability and the importance of graceful failure handling.

## Outcome

A robust automation system that demonstrates the principle of persistent, continuous operation - embodying the spirit of Sisyphus but with the efficiency of modern programming.
