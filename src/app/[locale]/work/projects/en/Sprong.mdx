## Overview

In this project, I made my own game inspired by classic-pong. The game was made to run on sprig a low level game console.

## Key Features

- **MultiPlayer and and SinglePlayer capability**: The game allows for both single player and multiplayer with the advent of a custom bot solely for pong.
- **Browser and sprig compatibility**: Thanks to the website of sprig being able to run games directly on their website, you don't even need to own a sprig to play. 

## Technologies Used

- **Javascript**: since all sprig games are made with javascript 
- **Sprig**: For running the game.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was just removing and figuring out bugs, I fixed one bug another one appeared. I am pretty sure I learned something about myself debugging the code.

## Outcome

A fun game
