## Overview

Development of an Advanced LineFollower using the PID algorithim, PCB and many more technologies. For more details click <a href="https://github.com/Licnex/Line-Follower">here </a>

## Key Features

- **PID**: Implemented a Proportional-Integral-Derivative control algorithm to ensure precise and stable line following.
- **PCB**: Designed custom printed circuit boards to integrate all components efficiently.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Developed comprehensive documentation so that anyone else may use the code or designs for ease.

## Technologies Used

- **Kicad**: For making good usable and flexable pcb boards.
- **PlatformIO IDE**: For uploading code across the microcontroller easily.
- **QTR IR sensors**: For a responsive and fast array of sensors.  
- **Esp32 s3 wroom 2**: For a fast computation wise microcontroller with the flexibility of having a wifi and bluetooth modual to customize PID constants.
