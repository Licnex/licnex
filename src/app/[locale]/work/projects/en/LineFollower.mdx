## Overview

**Sisyphus** is an advanced line-following robot that demonstrates sophisticated autonomous navigation using PID control algorithms, custom PCB design, and modern embedded systems. Named after the mythological figure condemned to endless repetition, this robot continuously and precisely follows lines with remarkable persistence and accuracy.

Development of an Advanced LineFollower using the PID algorithim, PCB and many more technologies. For more details click <a href="https://github.com/Licnex/Line-Follower">here </a>

## Key Features

- **PID**: Implemented a Proportional-Integral-Derivative control algorithm to ensure precise and stable line following.
- **PCB**: Designed custom printed circuit boards to integrate all components efficiently.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Developed comprehensive documentation so that anyone else may use the code or designs for ease.

## Technologies Used

- **Kicad**: For making good usable and flexable pcb boards.
- **PlatformIO IDE**: For uploading code across the microcontroller easily.
- **QTR IR sensors**: For a responsive and fast array of sensors.  
- **Esp32 s3 wroom 2**: For a fast computation wise microcontroller with the flexibility of having a wifi and bluetooth modual to customize PID constants.
